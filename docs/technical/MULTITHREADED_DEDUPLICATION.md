# Multi-threaded Hierarchical Deduplication

## Overview

The multi-threaded deduplication pipeline combines the **memory-efficient staged approach** with **parallel processing** to achieve maximum performance on multi-core systems while maintaining the same high-quality 5-stage hierarchical verification.

## Performance Problem with Sequential Processing

### Current Sequential Bottleneck
```python
# Sequential processing - SLOW
for group in groups:
    process_group(group)  # One group at a time
    # CPU cores 2-8 are idle while core 1 works
```

### CPU Utilization Issues
- **Single-core usage**: Only 1 CPU core utilized during processing
- **Idle resources**: 7 cores idle on 8-core system (87.5% waste)
- **Linear scaling**: Processing time grows linearly with dataset size
- **I/O bottlenecks**: Single thread waits for disk/cache operations

## Multi-threaded Solution: Parallel Group Processing

### Core Principle: "Process Multiple Groups Simultaneously"

```python
# Multi-threaded processing - FAST
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(process_group, group) for group in groups]
    # All 8 CPU cores working simultaneously
    results = [future.result() for future in as_completed(futures)]
```

## Implementation Architecture

### MultiThreadedDeduplicator Class

```python
class MultiThreadedDeduplicator(MemoryEfficientDeduplicator):
    """Multi-threaded memory-efficient hierarchical deduplicator."""
    
    def __init__(self, feature_cache, device="cpu", max_workers=None, chunk_size=10):
        super().__init__(feature_cache, device)
        
        # Auto-detect optimal thread count
        self.max_workers = max_workers or min(32, (os.cpu_count() or 1) + 4)
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size  # Groups per batch
        
        # Thread-safe locks
        self._cache_lock = threading.Lock()
        self._stats_lock = threading.Lock()
```

### Thread-Safe Design

#### 1. Protected Cache Access
```python
def _load_features_for_group(self, group, feature_type):
    with self._cache_lock:  # Thread-safe cache access
        group_features = {}
        for image_path in group:
            features = self.feature_cache.get_features(image_path)
            if features and feature_type in features:
                group_features[image_path] = features[feature_type]
    return group_features
```

#### 2. Protected Statistics Updates
```python
def update_stats(self, count):
    with self._stats_lock:  # Thread-safe stats
        self.memory_stats['features_loaded'] += count
```

#### 3. Thread-Safe Result Collection
```python
def process_batch(group_batch):
    batch_results = []
    for group in group_batch:
        result = process_group(group)
        batch_results.extend(result)
    
    with results_lock:  # Thread-safe result collection
        all_results.extend(batch_results)
```

## Multi-threaded Stage Implementation

### Stage 2: Multi-threaded Color Verification

```python
def _stage2_multithreaded_color_verification(self, wavelet_groups):
    # Filter groups suitable for parallel processing
    processable_groups = [group for group in wavelet_groups if 1 < len(group) <= 30]
    
    # Create batches for threading
    group_batches = [processable_groups[i:i + self.chunk_size] 
                    for i in range(0, len(processable_groups), self.chunk_size)]
    
    color_verified_groups = []
    results_lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def process_color_batch(group_batch):
        batch_results = []
        for group in group_batch:
            subgroups = self.verify_with_color_features(group)
            batch_results.extend(subgroups)
        
        with results_lock:
            color_verified_groups.extend(batch_results)
    
    # Process batches in parallel
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(process_color_batch, batch) for batch in group_batches]
        
        for future in tqdm(as_completed(futures), desc="Color verification"):
            future.result()
    
    return color_verified_groups
```

### Stage 3: Multi-threaded Global Refinement

```python
def _stage3_multithreaded_global_refinement(self, color_groups):
    processable_groups = [group for group in color_groups if 1 < len(group) <= 100]
    
    def process_global_batch(group_batch):
        batch_results = []
        for group in group_batch:
            # Thread-safe feature loading
            with self._cache_lock:
                global_features = self._load_features_for_group(group, 'global')
            
            if global_features:
                subgroups = self._refine_group_with_global_features(
                    list(global_features.keys()),
                    {path: {'global': feat} for path, feat in global_features.items()},
                    similarity_scores
                )
                batch_results.extend(subgroups)
                del global_features  # Immediate cleanup
        
        return batch_results
    
    # Parallel processing with automatic result collection
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(process_global_batch, batch) for batch in group_batches]
        
        global_refined_groups = []
        for future in as_completed(futures):
            global_refined_groups.extend(future.result())
    
    return global_refined_groups
```

### Stage 4: Multi-threaded Local Verification

```python
def _stage4_multithreaded_local_verification(self, global_groups):
    # Smaller chunks for memory-intensive local features
    local_chunk_size = max(1, self.chunk_size // 2)
    
    def process_local_batch(group_batch):
        batch_results = []
        for group in group_batch:
            with self._cache_lock:
                local_features = self._load_features_for_group(group, 'local')
            
            if local_features:
                subgroups = self._verify_group_with_local_features(
                    list(local_features.keys()),
                    {path: {'local': feat} for path, feat in local_features.items()},
                    similarity_scores
                )
                batch_results.extend(subgroups)
                del local_features  # Critical for memory management
        
        return batch_results
    
    # Process with reduced parallelism for memory safety
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
        # Process batches in parallel
        results = list(executor.map(process_local_batch, group_batches))
        
        local_verified_groups = []
        for batch_result in results:
            local_verified_groups.extend(batch_result)
    
    return local_verified_groups
```

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Adaptive Batch Sizing

```python
# Different batch sizes for different stages
stage_configs = {
    'color': {'chunk_size': self.chunk_size, 'max_workers': self.max_workers},
    'global': {'chunk_size': self.chunk_size, 'max_workers': self.max_workers},
    'local': {'chunk_size': self.chunk_size // 2, 'max_workers': self.max_workers}  # Smaller for memory
}
```

### 2. Memory-Aware Threading

```python
# Skip very large groups to prevent memory issues
if len(group) > memory_threshold:
    # Process sequentially for memory safety
    single_threaded_results.append(group)
    continue

# Only parallelize manageable groups
processable_groups = [g for g in groups if len(g) <= memory_threshold]
```

### 3. Intelligent Worker Count

```python
# Auto-detect optimal thread count
optimal_workers = min(32, (os.cpu_count() or 1) + 4)

# Factors considered:
# - CPU core count
# - I/O bound operations (extra threads help)
# - Memory constraints (don't overload)
# - System overhead (leave room for OS)
```

### Thread-Safe Memory Management

```python
# Each thread manages its own memory
def process_batch(group_batch):
    for group in group_batch:
        # Load features for this thread
        features = load_features(group)
        
        # Process the group
        result = process_group(group, features)
        
        # Immediate cleanup (thread-local)
        del features
        gc.collect()  # Force cleanup
    
    return results
```

## Configuration Options

### Performance vs Memory Trade-offs

```python
# High performance (more memory usage)
deduplicator = MultiThreadedDeduplicator(
    max_workers=16,          # More threads
    chunk_size=20            # Larger batches
)

# Balanced approach (default)
deduplicator = MultiThreadedDeduplicator(
    max_workers=8,           # Moderate threads
    chunk_size=10            # Medium batches
)

# Memory-conservative (slower but safer)
deduplicator = MultiThreadedDeduplicator(
    max_workers=4,           # Fewer threads
    chunk_size=5             # Smaller batches
)
```

### System-Specific Optimization

```python
import os

# Auto-detect optimal configuration
cpu_cores = os.cpu_count() or 1

if cpu_cores <= 2:
    # Low-end system
    max_workers = 2
    chunk_size = 3
elif cpu_cores <= 8:
    # Mid-range system  
    max_workers = cpu_cores
    chunk_size = 8
else:
    # High-end system
    max_workers = min(16, cpu_cores)
    chunk_size = 12

deduplicator = MultiThreadedDeduplicator(
    max_workers=max_workers,
    chunk_size=chunk_size
)
```

## Threading Statistics and Monitoring

### Performance Metrics
