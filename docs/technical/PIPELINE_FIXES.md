# Pipeline Connection Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes made to ensure proper connections between all pipeline steps in the image deduplication project.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Step 6: Azure Copy Process
**Problem**: The pipeline was missing the final step of copying deduplicated images to Azure output directory.

**Fix**: Added complete Azure copy functionality in `run_pipeline()`:
- Reads deduplication report to identify unique images
- Copies unique images to Azure output directory using `copy_blob()` method
- Saves copy results and provides detailed logging

### 2. Missing `copy_blob` Method in AzureBlobManager
**Problem**: The `AzureBlobManager` class was missing the `copy_blob` method needed for Step 6.

**Fix**: Added `copy_blob` method to `modules/azure_utils.py`:
```python
def copy_blob(self, source_blob_name: str, destination_blob_name: str) -> bool:
    """Copy a blob within the same container."""
    # Implementation with retry logic and rate limiting
```

### 3. Missing Feature Cache Module
**Problem**: The code was importing `BoundedFeatureCache` but the module didn't exist.

**Fix**: Created `modules/feature_cache.py` with complete implementation:
- `BoundedFeatureCache` class with memory and disk caching
- `put_features()`, `get_features()`, `get_all_features()` methods
- Compression/decompression using gzip and pickle
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking

### 4. Queue Management and Error Handling Issues
**Problem**: The pipeline had potential deadlocks and insufficient error handling.

**Fix**: Improved queue management in `run_pipeline()`:
- Better error handling with proper exception propagation
- Graceful shutdown sequence for all workers
- Progress tracking that persists across pipeline runs
- Proper resource cleanup in finally blocks

### 5. Progress Tracking Improvements
**Problem**: Progress tracking didn't handle the case where features were already saved but deduplication hadn't run.

**Fix**: Enhanced progress tracking:
- Checks for existing features before starting download/processing
- Supports resuming from any point in the pipeline
- Proper save/load functionality for progress state

### 6. Missing Import in Deduplication Module
**Problem**: Missing `Path` import in `modules/deduplication.py`.

**Fix**: Added missing import:
```python
from pathlib import Path
```

## Pipeline Flow After Fixes

### Step 1: Download Image List and Images
- Lists all blobs in Azure directory
- Downloads images with retry logic and rate limiting
- Supports resuming from previous runs

### Step 2: Feature Extraction
- Processes images through distributed GPU workers
- Extracts global, local, and wavelet features
- Handles batch processing for efficiency

### Step 3: Save Features Locally
- Saves features to local storage with Azure directory structure
- Uses compressed storage to save disk space
- Maintains mapping between Azure and local paths

### Step 4: Deduplication Process
- Runs after all features are extracted and saved
- Uses hierarchical deduplication with multiple feature types
- Creates detailed deduplication report

### Step 5: Create Deduplication Report
- Generates comprehensive report with duplicate groups
- Includes similarity scores and statistics
- Saves report to local filesystem

### Step 6: Copy Images to Azure Output Directory
- Reads deduplication report to identify unique images
- Copies unique images to new Azure directory
- Saves copy operation results and statistics

## Key Improvements

### 1. Robust Error Handling
- Each step has proper exception handling
- Pipeline can resume from any point after failure
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Resource Management
- Proper cleanup of GPU resources
- Memory management for large datasets
- Connection pooling for Azure operations

### 3. Progress Persistence
- Progress is saved after each step
- Pipeline can resume from any interruption
- Comprehensive progress tracking

### 4. Scalability
- Multi-threaded download workers
- Multi-GPU processing
- Configurable batch sizes and worker counts

## Testing

Created `test_pipeline_connections.py` to verify:
- Feature cache functionality
- Progress tracker operations
- Azure connection management
- Pipeline component imports

## Usage

To run the fixed pipeline:

```bash
python pipeline.py
```

To test the connections:

```bash
python test_pipeline_connections.py
```

## Configuration

Key configuration parameters in `pipeline.py`:
- `TARGET_DIR`: Azure directory to process
- `NUM_AZURE_CONNECTIONS`: Number of Azure connections
- `MIN_DOWNLOAD_WORKERS`: Minimum download workers
- `NUM_PROCESS_WORKERS`: Number of processing workers
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Batch size for GPU processing

## Monitoring

The pipeline provides comprehensive logging:
- Progress updates for each step
- Error details with stack traces
- Performance metrics
- Resource usage information

## Conclusion

All pipeline connections are now properly implemented and tested. The pipeline can:
1. Download images from Azure
2. Extract features efficiently
3. Save features locally
4. Perform deduplication
5. Generate reports
6. Copy results back to Azure

The system is robust, scalable, and can handle interruptions gracefully.
