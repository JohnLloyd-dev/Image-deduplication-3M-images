## üéØ Expected Behavior Simulation

### Small Dataset Test (50 images):

#### **Stage 1: Wavelet Grouping** (Single-threaded)
```
Input: 50 test images
Process: Sequential wavelet hash computation
Output: ~10 groups identified
Time: ~0.5s
```

#### **Stage 2: Multi-threaded Color Verification**
```
Input: 10 groups
Process: 
  - Split into 2 batches (5 groups each)
  - Process batches in parallel with 8 workers
  - Thread-safe result collection
Output: ~8 color-verified groups
Time: ~1.2s (vs ~3.0s single-threaded)
Speedup: 2.5x
```

#### **Stage 3: Multi-threaded Global Refinement**
```
Input: 8 groups
Process:
  - Split into 2 batches (4 groups each)
  - Load global features with cache lock
  - Process batches in parallel
  - Immediate memory cleanup per thread
Output: ~6 globally refined groups
Time: ~0.8s (vs ~2.1s single-threaded)
Speedup: 2.6x
```

#### **Stage 4: Multi-threaded Local Verification**
```
Input: 6 groups
Process:
  - Split into 3 batches (2 groups each, smaller for memory)
  - Load local features with cache lock
  - Process with reduced parallelism (memory-intensive)
  - Thread-safe statistics updates
Output: ~4 locally verified groups
Time: ~0.6s (vs ~1.5s single-threaded)
Speedup: 2.5x
```

#### **Stage 5: Quality Organization** (Single-threaded)
```
Input: 4 groups
Process: Sequential quality-based best selection
Output: 4 best images + organized duplicates
Time: ~0.2s
```

### **Overall Performance Simulation:**
```
Single-threaded total: ~7.3s
Multi-threaded total:  ~3.3s
Overall speedup:       2.2x
